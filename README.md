The simulation program for probe space station from orbital missions to landing
including several models (ballistics, landing, radio, surface activity, etc.).
The Pyhton language is used for satellite flight programs.

There are two models available in the current version of the simulator:

* **planets** - the first version of the engineering simulation dedicated to landing on planets and surface missions
* **earth** - the second version of the engineering simulation dedicated to missions on the Earth orbit.

Each model is supplemented by gravity calculators (**planets_gravity** and **earth_gravity** respectively).
